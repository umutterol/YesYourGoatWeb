# GOAT: Guild Swipe Prototype ‚Äî PDR

## Overview

A fast, web-deployable prototype that fuses Yes, Your Grace (leadership tradeoffs) and Reigns (binary swipe decisions with resource meters) with GOAT‚Äôs MMO-guild world, tone, and systemic hooks (IRL Traits, light Morale, optional Affinity). The player, as Guild Master, moderates guild/MMO dilemmas week-by-week via left/right choices. Outcomes adjust meters, character morale, and guild state. Every third week injects a curated ‚ÄúRaid Night Check‚Äù event that reads current meters and traits (no simulation system).

Primary target: 5‚Äì10 minutes/session, mobile-friendly inputs, desktop/web build.

References: see `GDDv1-1.md` for trait, morale, and terminology; reuse tone and naming.

## Goals

- Small scope: ship in 7‚Äì10 days with data-driven content.
- Swipe-speed choices: immediate feedback, visible meter deltas, short text.
- GOAT identity: IRL Traits, Kiss/Curse framing, morale hooks, barks.
- Web deploy: HTML/CSS/TypeScript SPA; minimal assets, fast loads.

## Non-Goals (Prototype)

- No tactical combat UI; dungeon outcomes are simulated rolls.
- No full inventory/gear UI; use simple party ‚Äúpower‚Äù rating.
- No complex narrative graph; use linear weeks + random events pool.

## Core Loop (Week-Based)

1) Draw an event card (request/dilemma) with two options.  
2) Player swipes/chooses Left/Right.  
3) Apply resource deltas, morale changes, and trait hooks.  
4) Trigger barks and log entry.  
5) Every 3rd week, inject a ‚ÄúRaid Night Check‚Äù event (authored card that reacts to current meters/traits).  
6) Continue until loss (any meter at 0) or week cap reached (prototype win at week 12).

## Resources & Loss Conditions

- Guild Funds: budget for boosts, fees, and recovery. Loss at 0.
- Server Reputation: public standing on the server; affects event weights and rewards. Loss at 0.
- Raid Readiness: abstract "power/availability/comp" of the roster. Loss at 0.
- Character Morale: 1-10 scale per character; affects performance and departure risk.

**Loss Conditions:**
- Any meter (Funds, Reputation, Readiness) hits 0
- Guild collapses if 3+ characters leave due to low morale
- Soft fail states surface warnings at <20% for meters

## Enhanced Morale System (1-10 Scale)

**Morale Ranges & Effects:**
- **10-8**: Excellent - May trigger positive events (chance to increase one resource)
- **7-5**: Good - Normal performance, no penalties
- **4**: Poor - Character cannot trigger positive effects of choice
- **3**: Poor - Character cannot trigger positive effects of choice, 10% chance to leave each week
- **2-1**: Critical - 25% (morale 2) or 35% (morale 1) chance to leave each week
- **0**: Departed - Character leaves the guild immediately

**Morale Management:**
- Characters start with random morale 5-7
- Events change morale by -3 to +3 based on event severity and choice appropriateness
- Minor events: ¬±1 morale (e.g., "AFK for snacks" = -1, "Great raid performance" = +1)
- Major events: ¬±2 morale (e.g., "Loot drama resolved fairly" = +2, "Guild member quits" = -2)
- Crisis events: ¬±3 morale (e.g., "Guild bank scandal" = -3, "Server first achievement" = +3)
- Low morale characters may trigger special "leaving negotiation" events
- No recruitment system - guild must survive with remaining characters

## Systems Integration (GOAT Hooks)

- IRL Traits (Kiss/Curse): 4‚Äì6 sample traits influence event outcomes and certain ‚ÄúRaid Night Check‚Äù cards.  
  - E.g., Theorycrafter: Choices emphasizing optimization gain small bonuses; band-aid solutions may incur minor penalties later.  
- Morale (lightweight): tracked per-character for authored hooks and barks only (no global threshold rules in prototype).
- Barks: short flavor lines when thresholds are crossed or traits trigger.  
- Affinity (optional): +1% Readiness gain if two specific members ‚Äútravel‚Äù together during contracts.

## Content Scope (Prototype)

- Event cards: 30 total (20 common, 8 uncommon, 2 rare ‚Äúmini-crisis‚Äù). All events relate to MMO players, guild operations, or MMO platform/dev changes.
- Characters: 6 guild members with 1 fixed IRL Trait each. No leveling.
- Contracts: 3 templates (Easy/Medium/Hard) with risk-reward sliders.
- Barks: 5‚Äì8 per trait, 10 generic morale/threshold barks.
- Art/UI: simple card frame, icon meters, portrait placeholders.

## Event Card Format (Data-Driven)

JSON-like entry stored in `resources/events`, loaded at start.

```
{
  "id": "loot_drama_01",
  "title": "Loot Council Meltdown",
  "body": "Two DPS claim BiS daggers from last night‚Äôs raid.",
  "tags": ["player_drama", "raid_loot"],
  "weights": {"base": 5, "rep_low": +1},
  "left": {
    "label": "Follow logs; award to top parse",

      {"when": "trait:drama_queen", "effect": {"morale_all": -1}},
      {"when": "morale:<40", "effect": {"readiness": -1}}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Data Schema (Locked)

- File: `resources/events/events.json`
- Event fields:
  - `id`: string, unique
  - `title`: short string (‚â§50 chars)
  - `body`: short string (‚â§120 chars)
  - `tags`: array of strings (e.g., `player_drama`, `raid_night_check`)
  - `weights`: `{ base: int, rep_low?: int, rep_high?: int }`
  - `left` / `right`:
    - `label`: short string
    - `effects`: object with keys in `funds|reputation|readiness|morale_all|morale_<charId>` and values ‚àí3..+3
    - `hooks`: array of `{ when: string, effect: effects }`
- Conditions DSL (allowed):

  - `morale:<op><value>` using any member‚Äôs morale as the check (e.g., `morale:<40`)
- Notes:
  - UI labels: show `reputation` as ‚ÄúServer Reputation‚Äù.
  - No week math or RNG in schema; authored effects only.
  - Full details: see `resources/events/schema.md`.

### Repository Note: Event Data Location

- Authoring location in this repo: `resources/events/events.json` (for review/versioning).
- Runtime in web app: load the same file from `resources/events/events.json` (served statically or copied by bundler).

## MMO Event Categories

- Player Drama: loot disputes, AFK blowups, meter wars, grief reports.
- Raid Logistics: comp gaps, healer burnout, bench rotations, late starts.
- Dev/Server: hotfix nerfs, maintenance extended, server lag, rollback.
- Meta Shifts: patch notes, tier list swaps, emergent strats, exploit fixes.
- Community/PR: streamer review, world chat rumor, recruitment trials.
- Market/Economy: guild bank deficit, consumables spike, boost requests.

## Sample Event Seeds (Swipe Prompts)

- AFK Tank: ‚ÄúMain tank missed pull timer again.‚Äù Left: bench 1 week (Readiness -1, Rep +1). Right: warn only (Rep -1, Morale MT -1).
- Patch Nerf: ‚ÄúYour top build got nerfed 8%.‚Äù Left: swap comp (Funds -1, Readiness +1). Right: resist change (Rep -1, Morale mixed).
- Server Outage: ‚ÄúUnexpected downtime ruins raid night.‚Äù Left: reschedule weekend (Funds -1, Rep +1). Right: push backup content (Readiness -1, Funds +1).
- Parse War: ‚ÄúTwo DPS flame each other over meters.‚Äù Left: public call-out (Rep -1, Readiness +1). Right: private mediation (Funds -1, Morale +1).
- Boost Request: ‚ÄúWhale offers gold for a carry.‚Äù Left: accept (Funds +2, Rep -1). Right: decline (Rep +1, Funds 0).
- Exploit Found: ‚ÄúCheese strat trivializes boss.‚Äù Left: use it pre-hotfix (Readiness +2, Rep -2). Right: avoid (Rep +1, Readiness 0).
- Recruitment Trial: ‚ÄúHealer applicant with mixed logs.‚Äù Left: fast-track trial (Readiness +1, Funds -1). Right: require VODs (Rep +1, slower Readiness).
- Streamer Spotlight: ‚ÄúMid-tier streamer covers your guild.‚Äù Left: invite collab (Funds -1, Rep +2). Right: ignore (Rep 0; Drama Queen -Morale).

## Raid Night Check (No Simulation)

- Cadence: inject one `raid_night_check` card every 3rd week.  
- Card behavior: authored effects that may read current `reputation`, `readiness`, and active `trait:*` hooks to modify deltas.  
- Outcomes: apply standard effects only; optional flavor log line summarizing ‚Äúhow raid went‚Äù based on chosen option and hooks.  
- No RNG or power calculations in prototype.

## UI/UX

- **Reigns-Style Layout**: Top resource bar with fill dots, center event card with embedded character portrait, bottom roster display
- **Resource Display**: Horizontal icons (üí∞‚≠ê‚öîÔ∏è) with 10-dot fill indicators above each icon based on resource levels (1-10 scale)
- **Event Card Design**: Large event text at top, embedded character portrait with dynamic saturation effects, no visible choice buttons
- **Character Portraits**: Dynamic vertical gradient saturation based on morale - low morale shows desaturation from bottom to top
- **Swipe Mechanics**: Touch and mouse drag support with visual feedback, choice previews during swipe, directional indicators
- **Inputs**: Swipe/touch, left/right arrow keys, A/D keys, or click buttons
- **Feedback**: Animated meter ticks, character portrait effects, choice previews, running log
- **Accessibility**: Color + icon for meter deltas, visual saturation effects for character state

## Roster (Prototype)

- MT Kade ‚Äî Role: Tank ‚Äî Trait: Hardcore Permadeather (`hardcore_permadeather`) ‚Äî Stoic raid dad; threatens to delete if he dies.
- Lina ‚ÄúVODs4Days‚Äù ‚Äî Role: Healer ‚Äî Trait: Theorycrafter (`theorycrafter`) ‚Äî Sends spreadsheets at 3 a.m.
- Rix ‚ÄúCritlord‚Äù ‚Äî Role: Melee DPS ‚Äî Trait: Drama Queen (`drama_queen`) ‚Äî Performs best when everyone‚Äôs watching.
- Nyx ‚ÄúAlt+Tab‚Äù ‚Äî Role: Ranged DPS ‚Äî Trait: AFK Farmer (`afk_farmer`) ‚Äî AFK for snacks, top damage on return.
- Vale ‚ÄúTierListTV‚Äù ‚Äî Role: Flex DPS ‚Äî Trait: Meta Slave (`meta_slave`) ‚Äî Only uses S-tier builds.
- Mara ‚ÄúShotcaller‚Äù ‚Äî Role: Support ‚Äî Trait: Guild Leader (`guild_leader`) ‚Äî Insists on slot 1 or bust.

Character IDs for morale hooks: `kade`, `lina`, `rix`, `nyx`, `vale`, `mara` (use as `morale_<id>` if needed).
See trait definitions and barks: `resources/traits/traits.md`.

## Trait Hook Cookbook (Prototype)

- Theorycrafter (`theorycrafter`):
  - Tags: `meta_shifts`, `raid_logistics`, `raid_night_check`.
  - Hooks: reward optimization choices (+readiness), penalize band-aids (‚àíreputation) on repeat quick fixes.
  - Example: `{ when: "trait:theorycrafter", effect: { "readiness": +1 } }`.
- Drama Queen (`drama_queen`):
  - Tags: `player_drama`, `community_pr`.
  - Hooks: public call-outs lower morale_all; appeasement raises rep but risks morale dips later.
  - Example: `{ when: "trait:drama_queen", effect: { "morale_all": -1 } }`.
- AFK Farmer (`afk_farmer`):
  - Tags: `player_drama`, `raid_logistics`.
  - Hooks: postponing increases readiness next week; forcing play lowers reputation.
  - Example: `{ when: "trait:afk_farmer", effect: { "readiness": +1 } }`.
- Guild Leader (`guild_leader`):
  - Tags: `raid_night_check`, `raid_logistics`.
  - Hooks: structured plans boost rep; chaotic choices reduce readiness.
  - Example: `{ when: "trait:guild_leader", effect: { "reputation": +1 } }`.
- Meta Slave (`meta_slave`):
  - Tags: `meta_economy`, `meta_shifts`.
  - Hooks: following tier lists boosts readiness but may reduce morale_all on off-meta.
  - Example: `{ when: "trait:meta_slave", effect: { "readiness": +1 } }`.
- Hardcore Permadeather (`hardcore_permadeather`):
  - Tags: `raid_night_check`, `player_drama`.
  - Hooks: high-risk choices can boost rep but reduce morale_all on failure.
  - Example: `{ when: "trait:hardcore_permadeather", effect: { "reputation": +1 } }`.

## Web Architecture Outline

- EventDeck: loads `events.json`, filters by tags/weights, injects `raid_night_check` on weeks % 3 == 0.
- ChoiceResolver: applies effects and hook effects; clamps meters 0‚Äì10; appends to session log.
- MeterState: holds `funds`, `reputation`, `readiness`; per-character morale map; save/load to localStorage.
- TraitSystem: evaluates `trait:*` conditions against roster; exposes simple `HasTrait(id)`.
- BarkBus: rate-limited emitter for trait/morale barks; subscribes to ChoiceResolver outcomes.
- UI: meters bar, card panel, left/right buttons, swipe gesture; small toast system for deltas and barks.

### YesYourGoat Mode (Collapse Run)
- Route: `/yesyourgoat` (client-side routed in `web-ts`)
- Cadence: Moderator intro/outro, Council every ~5 events, Rival at least once mid-run, Journey milestones at events survived [3,6,9,12,15,18]
- Collapse Override: on any meter hitting 0, draw a matching `meta:collapse` event by `cause:*`
- Persistence: `yyg_collapse_count`, `yyg_history` in `localStorage`
- Event Source: `public/resources/events/yesyourgoat.events.json` generated via prebuild validator/merge
- Authoring Rules: enforced by `spinoff_authoring_guide.md` (two choices; effects keys funds|reputation|readiness|morale_*; values ‚àí3..+3; required tags)

#### Conversational Authoring (Reigns-like)
- Each event should read like a dialog: a single `speaker` addresses the Guildmaster; choices are short replies.
- Optional `portrait` string points to an image under `public/resources/portraits/`.
- Validator: recommends `speaker` for all non-collapse/non-runmeta events; warns if missing (non-blocking), enforces `portrait` type when present.
- UI: YesYourGoat card displays `speaker` and `portrait` above title; choices remain concise.

Example (schema addition):
```
{
  "id": "council_audit_01",
  "title": "Surprise Audit",
  "speaker": "Councilor",
  "portrait": "/resources/portraits/archmage.png",
  "body": "Your ledgers are‚Ä¶ thin. Shall we settle the fees now, Guildmaster?",
  "tags": ["meta:council"],
  "left": {"label": "We‚Äôll pay.", "effects": {"funds": -2}},
  "right": {"label": "We‚Äôll delay.", "effects": {"reputation": -2}}
}
```

### Tooling
- Tailwind CSS adopted in `web-ts` (utility-first styling)
- Prebuild validator+merge script at `web-ts/scripts/validate_merge_yesyourgoat.mjs` merges packs from `web-ts/resources/events/packs/yesyourgoat/*.json` to runtime file


## Tech Plan (Web Deploy)

- Stack: TypeScript + Vite + React (or Svelte/Vue).  
- Data: JSON for events, traits, and characters.  
- Architecture (Web):  
  - Systems: `EventDeck`, `ChoiceResolver`, `MeterState`, `TraitSystem`, `BarkBus`.  
  - Views: SPA with component-based UI; fetch static JSON.  
  - Save: localStorage; store meters, week, RNG seed.  
- Build: strip engine features; target <10‚Äì15MB initial load; limit audio.

## Acceptance Criteria

- 30 events playable end-to-end with visible meter changes.  
- Loss condition triggers and shows a summary.  
- Inject a `raid_night_check` card every 3 weeks that reacts to meters/traits (no sim).  
- 6 characters with fixed traits altering at least 10% of events.  
- Barks appear on: trait trigger, morale threshold, contract outcome.  
- Web build runs smoothly on desktop + mobile browser; inputs work.

## Test Checklist

- Meter clamping: never exceed [0, 10] in prototype.  
- Event weights adjust with Server Reputation low/high.  
- Hooks: at least one left/right choice uses a trait modifier.  
 - Raid Night cadence: every 3rd week draws from `raid_night_check` tag.  
- Save/Load: refresh preserves state across sessions.  
- Performance: target 60fps on desktop; acceptable on mobile.

## Content Budget (Prototype)

- Events: author 8 player_drama, 8 raid_logistics, 6 dev/server, 6 meta/economy, 2 rare crises.  
- Traits (sample): Theorycrafter, Drama Queen, AFK Farmer, Guild Leader, Meta Slave, Hardcore.  
- Raid Night Check: author 4 specialized cards tagged `raid_night_check` that reference meters/traits.  
- Bark Pool: 10-12 lines per trait (see `resources/barks/trait_barks.json`).

## Production Plan (7‚Äì10 days)

- Day 1: meters, state loop, stub UI.  
- Day 2: data loader, choice resolver, logging.  
- Day 3: traits and hooks, bark bus.  
- Day 4: finalize raid night cadence rules, loss flow.  
- Day 5: polish feedback, save/load.  
- Day 6‚Äì7: author 30 events + barks, balance.  
- Day 8‚Äì10: QA loop, web build tuning, cut risky extras.

## Future Extensions (Post-Prototype)

- Map view with contract selection and event preview.  
- Light roster UI and injury timers.  
- Affinity bonuses and duo events.  
- Tactical combat vignette for key crises.

## Adventure Mode System

### **üéÆ Adventure Mode Overview**
Adventure Mode transforms the guild management prototype into focused, narrative-driven experiences where players lead their guild through predefined multi-step event chains. Each adventure tells a complete story from preparation to completion, with branching paths and meaningful consequences.

### **üìö Adventure Structure**
- **Multi-Step Event Chains**: 6-10 connected events per adventure
- **Branching Narratives**: Main choices lead to different substeps
- **Resource Management**: Same Funds/Reputation/Readiness/Morale system
- **Story Moments**: Narrative events that provide flavor without gameplay impact
- **Adventure Completion**: Success/failure based on final resource levels

### **üéØ Adventure Progression Difficulty Curve**
Based on extensive simulation testing, adventures are designed with increasing difficulty:

- **Adventure 1: "The Great Guild Raid"** - 66% win rate (Beginner-friendly)
  - Learning the ropes, reduced penalties, manageable challenges
  - Perfect for introducing players to adventure mechanics

- **Adventure 2: "The Loot Council Crisis"** - 55% win rate (Intermediate)
  - Increased challenge, more complex decision trees
  - Players understand mechanics, ready for harder choices

- **Adventure 3: "The Server Transfer"** - 45% win rate (Expert)
  - High-stakes decisions, significant resource penalties
  - For experienced players seeking challenge

- **Adventure 4: "The Guild Merger"** - 35% win rate (Master)
  - Maximum difficulty, complex trait interactions
  - Ultimate test of strategic decision-making

### **üìä Balance Testing Results**
Through 100-run simulations, we achieved optimal balance:
- **Resource Distribution**: All resources (Funds, Reputation, Readiness, Morale) remain meaningful threats
- **Failure Points**: Multiple steps can cause failure, preventing single-point-of-failure design
- **Trait Integration**: Character traits create natural drama and conflict without character removal
- **Replayability**: Different trait combinations create unique experiences

### **üé™ Story Event Integration**
Adventures include two types of events:
- **Gameplay Events**: Affect resources and progression
- **Story Events**: Pure narrative moments that add flavor and character development
- **Hybrid Events**: Story moments with minor resource effects
