# YesYourGoat: Narrative Design & Progression System

## üéØ **Core Philosophy: "The Guild That Never Dies"**

Transform the game from "survive as long as possible" to "build a legendary guild that transcends individual runs." Each collapse becomes a stepping stone in a larger story.

---

## üìñ **1. OVERARCHING NARRATIVE: "The Eternal Guild"**

### **The Meta-Story**
- **The Guild is Eternal**: Each "collapse" is just a chapter in the guild's history
- **The Guildmaster is Immortal**: You're not just managing one guild - you're the eternal spirit of guild leadership
- **The World Remembers**: Your past decisions create the world you inherit in future runs

### **Narrative Hooks**
- **"The Guild That Never Dies"** - Your guild has a reputation that spans centuries
- **"The Eternal Guildmaster"** - You're not just a person, you're a legend
- **"The World That Remembers"** - Past decisions echo through time

---

## üèÜ **2. LONG-TERM PROGRESSION: "Guild Legacy System"**

### **Legacy Points** (Replaces simple collapse count)
- Earned based on **how** you collapse, not just **when**
- Different collapse types give different legacy points
- Unlock new content, characters, and storylines

### **Legacy Categories**
- **"The Martyr"** - Collapse defending principles (high reputation, low funds)
- **"The Pragmatist"** - Collapse from calculated risks (balanced meters)
- **"The Dreamer"** - Collapse pursuing impossible goals (high readiness, low reputation)
- **"The Survivor"** - Collapse from exhaustion (deck exhaustion)
- **"The Legend"** - Collapse from overreach (all meters high but catastrophic event)

### **Progressive Unlocks**
- **New Characters**: Unlock legendary guildmasters from history
- **New Event Packs**: Unlock storylines from different eras
- **New Mechanics**: Unlock advanced guild management features
- **New Endings**: Unlock different ways to "win" or "lose"

---

## üé≠ **3. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: "Living Guild Members"**

### **Character Personalities** (Not just stats)
- Each character has a **personality archetype** that affects their events
- Characters **remember** past interactions across runs
- Characters **evolve** based on your leadership style

### **Character Relationships**
- **Rivalries**: Some characters hate each other
- **Friendships**: Some characters support each other
- **Mentorship**: Experienced characters guide newcomers
- **Romance**: Some characters develop relationships

### **Character Arcs**
- **The Rookie**: Starts weak, grows stronger with good leadership
- **The Veteran**: Starts strong, but can burn out or become jaded
- **The Wildcard**: Unpredictable, can be your greatest asset or biggest problem
- **The Loyalist**: Always supports you, but may enable bad decisions

---

## üåü **4. CHAOS MOMENTS: "The Unexpected"**

### **Random Events** (Not in the main deck)
- **"The Wildcard"** - Completely unexpected events that can change everything
- **"The Prophecy"** - Events that hint at future storylines
- **"The Echo"** - Events that reference past runs
- **"The Revelation"** - Events that reveal hidden truths about the world

### **Chaos Triggers**
- **High Stakes**: When all meters are high, chaos events become more likely
- **Low Stakes**: When all meters are low, chaos events become more likely
- **Specific Combinations**: Certain meter combinations trigger specific chaos
- **Legacy Milestones**: Reaching certain legacy points triggers chaos

### **Chaos Examples**
- **"The Time Loop"** - An event that references a past run
- **"The Prophecy"** - An event that hints at future storylines
- **"The Revelation"** - An event that reveals hidden truths
- **"The Wildcard"** - An event that completely changes the rules

## üéÆ **CONCLUSION: "The Guild That Never Dies"**

This design transforms YesYourGoat from a simple survival game into an epic saga of guild management. Players aren't just trying to survive - they're building a legendary guild that transcends individual runs. Each collapse becomes a stepping stone in a larger story, and each decision echoes through time.

The core left/right mechanic remains unchanged, but now every choice matters in ways that extend far beyond the current run. Players will care about their characters, invest in their decisions, and feel proud of their guild's legacy.

This is how you make a game that players can't put down.
