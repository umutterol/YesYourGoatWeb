# META-NARRATIVE DESIGN: YesYourGoat

## üé≠ **Core Meta-Narrative: "The Eternal Simulation"**

### **The Truth**
- **Every player in the MMO is an AI replica** of the original game designer
- **The MMO is a simulation/test** orchestrated by mysterious Game Masters
- **Players don't know they're not real people** - they think they're playing a normal MMO
- **The cycle is inevitable** - there's no way to break the simulation
- **The Guild is Eternal** - it has existed through countless iterations
- **The Guildmaster is Immortal** - but not in the way they think

### **The Simulation's Purpose**
- **Testing AI behavior** in complex social situations
- **Studying decision-making patterns** under pressure
- **Observing how AI replicas handle failure and success**
- **Understanding the psychology of leadership** in virtual environments
- **Preparing for... something bigger**

## üéØ **Story Pacing & Revelation Triggers**

### **Phase 1: Normal MMO (Runs 1-3)**
- **Trigger**: 5+ Legacy Points
- **Experience**: Regular guild management
- **Player Knowledge**: None - thinks it's a normal MMO
- **Events**: Standard guild events, resource management
- **Visual**: Normal UI, standard portraits

### **Phase 2: Glitches Appear (Runs 4-8)**
- **Trigger**: 10+ Legacy Points
- **Experience**: MissingNo-style glitch events start appearing
- **Player Knowledge**: Something's wrong, but not sure what
- **Events**: Glitch events mixed with normal events
- **Visual**: Subtle UI glitches, corrupted text

### **Phase 3: Simulation Revealed (Runs 9-15)**
- **Trigger**: 20+ Legacy Points
- **Experience**: Mysterious Game Masters appear
- **Player Knowledge**: "This might be a simulation..."
- **Events**: Game Master offers, glitch events increase
- **Visual**: UI becomes more artificial, glitch effects

### **Phase 4: The Truth (Runs 16+)**
- **Trigger**: 50+ Legacy Points
- **Experience**: Full revelation of the meta-narrative
- **Player Knowledge**: "I'm an AI replica in a test..."
- **Events**: Meta-narrative events, simulation references
- **Visual**: Completely artificial UI, glitch overload

## üé≤ **Glitch Events System**

### **Core Glitch Events (Subtle MMO Interactions)**
1. **Same Event Twice** - "Haven't we dealt with this before?" (feels like MMO repetition)
2. **Event Text Slightly Off** - "The guild's reputation is... stable?" (feels like MMO text bug)
3. **Character Appears Twice** - "I'm back from my other duties" (feels like MMO scheduling)
4. **Event Text Slightly Corrupted** - "The guild's reputation is... good?" (feels like MMO text glitch)
5. **Character Speaks Formally** - "System message: Event processing..." (feels like MMO admin)
6. **Event Text Has Typos** - "The guild's reputaion is stable" (feels like MMO typo)
7. **Character Role Changes** - "I'm the new tank now" (feels like MMO role swap)
8. **Event References Development** - "The devs are working on this" (feels like MMO community)
9. **Character Mentions Meta** - "This game is getting repetitive" (feels like MMO player complaint)
10. **Event Text Backwards** - "!gnidaer uoy era tahW" (feels like MMO text corruption)
11. **Character Appears as Different Character** - "I'm the Tank now, not the Mage..." (feels like MMO role confusion)
12. **Event Text Corrupted** - "The guild's [REDACTED] is [CORRUPTED]..." (feels like MMO data corruption)
13. **Character Speaks in Code** - "ERROR: Event not found. Loading backup..." (feels like MMO system error)
14. **Real-World Data Integration** - Uses actual player data (OS, Steam history, etc.) in subtle ways

### **Real-World Data Integration Examples**
- **OS Detection**: "Your Windows 11 system is running smoothly" (feels like MMO system check)
- **Steam History**: "I see you've been playing a lot of strategy games lately" (feels like MMO recommendation)
- **Browser Data**: "Your Chrome browser is up to date" (feels like MMO compatibility check)
- **Time Zone**: "It's 3 PM in your timezone, perfect for guild activities" (feels like MMO scheduling)
- **Hardware**: "Your RTX 3080 should handle this raid fine" (feels like MMO performance check)
- **Location**: "Players in your region are very active today" (feels like MMO regional stats)
- **Game History**: "You've been playing for 2 hours straight, take a break" (feels like MMO health reminder)

### **Glitch Event Triggers**
- **Rarity**: 5% chance per event (increases with Legacy Points)
- **Frequency**: More common in later phases
- **Player Experience**: Feels like normal MMO interactions with subtle "off" moments
- **Character Awareness**: Characters remain completely oblivious to glitches
- **Response**: Player gets normal dialogue options, characters act normally
- **Subtlety**: Glitches feel like MMO bugs, repetition, or development issues

## üë• **Character System & Relationships**

### **Character Personalities**
- **Rookie**: Eager, naive, asks questions
- **Veteran**: Experienced, cynical, knows the patterns
- **Wildcard**: Unpredictable, chaotic, breaks rules
- **Loyalist**: Devoted, follows orders, never questions

### **Character Relationships**
- **Static but Chaotic**: Characters have fixed relationships but they're unpredictable
- **Player-Centric**: Focus on player's relationship with characters, not inter-character
- **Memory System**: Characters remember past interactions
- **Growth**: Characters evolve based on player choices

### **Character Arcs**
- **Rookie ‚Üí Veteran**: Learns from player's leadership
- **Veteran ‚Üí Cynic**: Becomes disillusioned with the cycle
- **Wildcard ‚Üí Rebel**: Tries to break the simulation
- **Loyalist ‚Üí Martyr**: Sacrifices for the guild

### **Character Glitch Awareness**
- **Characters NEVER mention glitches** - they act as if everything is normal
- **Characters NEVER reference past runs** - they don't remember previous iterations
- **Characters NEVER question the simulation** - they're completely unaware
- **Only the player** experiences the "deja vu" and glitch recognition
- **Characters maintain their personality** even during glitch events

## üéÆ **Game Master System**

### **Mysterious Game Masters**
- **Nature**: AI agents orchestrating the simulation
- **Appearance**: Shadowy, never fully revealed
- **Purpose**: Test the AI replicas, maintain the simulation
- **Offers**: Power, resources, knowledge (with hidden costs)
- **Manipulation**: Never reveal the full consequences upfront

### **Game Master Offers**
- **Power**: "We can give your guild legendary weapons..."
- **Resources**: "We can boost your server reputation..."

- **Escape**: "We can help you break the cycle..." (lie)

### **Hidden Consequences**
- **Power**: Guild becomes dependent on external help
- **Resources**: Guild loses autonomy
- **Knowledge**: Player becomes paranoid
- **Escape**: Player becomes trapped in a different simulation

**YesYourGoat is not just a guild management game. It's a meta-commentary on AI, simulation, and the nature of reality.

The cycle is inevitable, but every choice matters, every relationship counts, and every run teaches the simulation something new.**

**The Guild is Eternal. The Guildmaster is Immortal. The Simulation Continues.**
